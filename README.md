# Stephan-mit-Ph Personal Website

This repository is for my personal website and my second project as a Web Developer.
After using the Next.js Page Routing for my first project, I wanted to try out Next.js new App Routing Feature to get more familiar with the framework and the rendering methods. This Project will also be my personal playgound to try different techniques and technologies.

If you running into any issues or have any questions, please let me know. It would be great to get some feedback on my code and the website itself.
